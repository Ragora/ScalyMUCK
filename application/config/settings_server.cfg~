# Configuration file for ScalyMUCK Server

# All you'd ever really need to adjust is this server port. Make sure it's some number above 1024 as on Linux systems, 1024 and below does not work as a
# valid port number.
ServerPort=2000
ServerAddress=0.0.0.0

# This is used when hashing passwords to be stored in the database, it basically tells the software how many times the hashing algorithm should be applied
# before storing the password. With that being said, the higher the value the more computations that must occur and therefore should be adjusted accordingly
# for your specific server. This is used to prevent timing attacks.
WorkFactor=10

# Failed login block number. If set to a number above 0 (otherwise it's disabled), ScalyMUCK will block logins from an IP address that fails to login after
# the specified number of attempts. How long these blocks last is specified by the FailedLoginTimeout entry below.
FailedAttempts=3
# How long in minutes an IP should be blocked after it has failed repeatedly to login. If set to zero, blocks are permeneant...
FailedLoginTimeout=60
# How long in seconds between logins before incrementing the "Failed login" counter. This is used to give users some grace while bots will be denied, however
# it's not difficult to program a bot to work within this time frame as well.
FailedLoginGrace=2

# Debug mode should only be used on dev servers and not actual production servers as it purposely flips off the safe execution mechanism in ScalyMUCK that
# allows the application to painlessly report an error in the event an error occurs within a modification rather than just explode all over the place. This
# is useful when developing modifications as the safe execution mechanism cannot report detailed errors and therefore will make debugging of modification
# components significantly harder.
Debug=Yes
