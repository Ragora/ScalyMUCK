This is just an experimental MUCK server I'm working on every once and a while. It should by no means
be used for anything practical at the moment as I cannot guarantee it's dependability (as I will not
thoroughly test the code right now).

	I. Foreword
	===============================
	
	As stated above, the current verison of this MUCK server is simply experimental and should
	be considered altogether unstable unless you're fond of backing up data constantly and
	griping about bugs.
	
	===============================
	II.	Usage
	===============================
	
	Windows: Download & Install Python from http://www.python.org/
	You must then download and install setup tools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
	and make sure C:\Pythonx\Lib\site-packages\ is set on your PATH. (The X being your specific
	python Version)
	After this entry is added to your PATH, you may run "easy_install pbkdf2" to automatically
	download and install the pbkdf2 requirement.
	
	
	Linux: Most Linux based OS' should have a Python runtime built in as it is. With that being
	said, to fulfill the pbkdf2 requirement you should just be able to
	
	The server was programmed on a Python 2.7.3 runtime, so if you have issues running this on
	any other version, try upgrading/downgrading to this version first.
