# ScalyMUCK	Version 3.5.0

ScalyMUCK is multi-user chat kingdom software written for Python 2.7 that started life as a pet project of mine to work
on when there was nothing much else of interest to be doing. It eventually grew into a full-fledged server implementation
whose capabilities rival that of other MUCK servers with features such as using a module based architecture for mod 
support, usage of SQLAlchemy for robust database support for SQLite and MySQL and usage of Blinker for event emitting
and receiving.
